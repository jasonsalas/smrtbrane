### Fun with neural network programming in Python

This is a basic neural network that self-optimizes and makes predictions about values in a simple matrix. Thanks to [@iamtrask](http://twitter.com/iamtrask) for the [excellent - and incredibly terse! - demo](http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/).
